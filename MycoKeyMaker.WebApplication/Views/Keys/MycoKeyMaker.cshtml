<p>
    MycoKeyMaker is a free software package with desktop and web applications for the creation
    and display of online fungi keys stored in a Microsoft SQLServer database.
</p>
<p>
    The desktop application allows the user to create and edit the keys:
</p>
@{
    <img src="/Images/KeyEditor.png" style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px;" border="0">
}
<p>
    The desktop application is written in C# and .Net and runs on a Windows PC.
</p>
<p>
    The web application creates a web site containing online keys. It is written in Asp.Net Core. 
</p>
<p>
    You are welcome to use the software to create your own web site. You will of course have to edit
    some pages to suit your needs. Alternatively you can create a database, and I will add it to
    this web site. There is currently no documentation available: I will create some as and when it is
    needed. The software is still in development.
